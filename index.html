      <p>Transit Master - Chicago CTA uses a sleek, clean, and minimalist design, to help you get CTA Bus and Train ('L') stop and prediction info easily and fast.</p>

<p>With the help of the app, you can always have confidence and peace of mind when using CTA to get around the city anywhere anytime. </p>

<p>Become a Master of Chicago's Public Transit today!</p>

<p>This is an universal app that works great and responsively on both iPhone/iPod Touch and iPad, NO need to pay twice for the same app!</p>

<p>• Color-coded prediction times give you a quick scan of what's coming up:
Red: arriving within 5 minutes.
Blue: arriving between 6 ~ 10 minutes.
Grey: arriving in more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>• Toggle predictions display</p>

<ul>
<li>Tap on bus route number/train line name to toggle whether to show vehicle ID and current distance to the stop</li>
<li>Tap on prediction times to toggle ETA in minutes left, or in your local time</li>
<li>Tap on the "ALL" button to toggle whether to show predictions for the selected route, or for all routes at the stop</li>
<li>Tap on route destinations to toggle whether to sort predictions by ETA, or by route</li>
</ul>

<p>• Look up predictions easily 
Scroll or Search routes/directions/stops. Routes and Directions are ordered alphabetically; Stops and Favorites can be ordered either alphabetically or by distance to your current location (turn on Geolocation by tapping on the tracking icon on the top left).</p>

<p>• Search train stops
Type the line color (blue/brown/green/orange/pink/purple/red/yellow) or stop name to filter train stops.</p>

<p>• When at a bus stop 
Use the "Find a Stop by Stop ID" feature and type in the stop's ID, which should be displayed on the bus routes board, to get faster access of the predictions.</p>

<p>• Fresh and dynamic public transit data powered by Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) tracking service
NOT static bus schedules. </p>

<p>• Automatic data refresh
Vehicle arrival predictions are automatically refreshed every minute, which is the minimal update interval supported by CTA's tracking service. No manual effort needed.</p>

<p>• Data caching
The app caches as much static information as possible, such as routes/directions/stops, to help reducing your phone's unnecessary data usage, and boost tracking speed. The cache will be automatically refreshed in reasonable intervals to keep the data fresh.</p>

<p>Happy predicting and riding!</p>
